# PathFinder Unity
Welcome to my Unity project PathFinder Unity! I hope you have as much fun using this application as I had building it. I've Uploaded all the Scripts that I wrote for the project in the repository. 
## Set Up
This is Windows Version of the application if you are on Mac please use this repository instead https://github.com/nikolozc/PathFinderUnityMac

Download the Zip file and run the 'PathFinderUnity.exe' file, enjoy!
## Quick Tutorial
There is a tutorial that will guide you though the app, but I've decided to include it here aswell. 
The mouse is the start node (algorithm starts the search from start node) and the cheese is the end node (algorithm looks for the end node to complete the search)
You can hold Left mouse button over mouse/cheese and move it around the grid
### Controls
You can you **arrow** keys to move the camera around the grid, **Left Shift** and **Left Ctrl** zoom in/out
You will also have set of tool on the UI that will add/remove walls and weights from the grid or you can also use keyboard shortcuts.
you can hold the keyboard shortcut while hovering over the object to get the same result as the tools from UI.
- **Q** Remove Weight
- **W** Add Weight
- **E** Add Wall
- **R** Remove Wall

Enjoy!
